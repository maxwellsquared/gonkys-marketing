# Gonky's Marketing Helps You Be Good at Business

Blogs can be a useful marketing tool, but sometimes you'd rather just build your product.

Gonky is the funky dancing ape who loves to write blog articles for startups.

Feed him a subject and he'll spit out not just an article but also tweets and Facebook/LinkedIn posts to promote it.

Gonky needs an OpenAI API key for now: just copy our .env.example file, enter your API key, and rename it to '.env.' Then run npm start and visit Gonky at http://localhost:3000 in your browser!
